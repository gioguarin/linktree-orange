# 📋 Linktree Orange - Project Plan

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Linktree Orange** is a modern, feature-rich linktree website with persistent analytics powered by Redis. The project demonstrates full-stack development with a focus on user experience, performance, and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Build**: Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: Redis (local or cloud via Upstash)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Deployment**: Separate from frontend (Railway/Heroku/Render)

### Data Flow
```
User Click → Frontend → API Server → Redis → Response → Frontend Update
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Redis Keys
```
clicks:{link_name} → integer (click count)
theme:{user_id} → string (light/dark)
profile:{user_id} → hash (user profile data)
```

### Example Data Structure
```javascript
// Click counts
{
  "clicks:twitter": 42,
  "clicks:instagram": 28,
  "clicks:github": 15,
  "clicks:linkedin": 8
}

// User preferences
{
  "theme:user123": "dark",
  "profile:user123": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "bio": "Developer & Designer",
    "avatar": "https://..."
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations
